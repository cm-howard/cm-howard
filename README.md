I'm Chris Howard, an Open Source advocate and previously I was the Head of the Open Source Program Office at <a href="http://www.epam.com">@EPAM Systems</a> where I was looking after a growing community of open source contributors, a range of clients open-sourcing their own solutions and of course helping build an incredible developer community. IÂ´m now looking for an exciting new opportunity but until then IÂ´m also involved in a few other things including some of these roles below... 

Chief Learning Officer & Ambassador <a href="http://www.openuk.uk">@OpenUK</a><br/>
D&I SIG Group Member <a href="https://www.finos.org/">@FINOS</a><br/>
Green Software Champion <a href="https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/">@Green Software Foundation</a></br>
Advisory Board Member for <a href="https://careeraccelerator.io/">@CareerAccelerator</a> and <a href="https://incredibleeverydaywoman.com/">@TheIncredibleEverydayWoman</a><br/>

<h3>ðŸ’» Projects I'm busy with...</h3>

<a href="https://www.github.com/epam/osci">Open Source Contributors Index (OSCI)</a>
<br>OSCI ranks corporate contributions to open source based on the organizationâ€™s number of Active Contributors to GitHub. OSCI also tracks the Total Community of open source contributors for these companies. There's a great product team at EPAM leading this as well as some fantastic external contributors too.

<a href="https://github.com/todogroup/todogroup.org">TODO Group</a>
<br>TODO is an open group of organizations that collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective open source projects and programs. I'm currently sharing some of our ways of working and supporting where possible.
