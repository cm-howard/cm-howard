<h3>Things I'm busy with...</h3>

<a href="https://www.github.com/epam/osci">Open Source Contributors Index (OSCI)</a>
<br>OSCI ranks corporate contributions to open source based on the organizationâ€™s number of Active Contributors to GitHub. OSCI also tracks the Total Community of open source contributors for these companies. There's a great product team at EPAM leading this as well as some fantastic external contributors too. 

<a href="https://github.com/finos/TimeBase-CE">TimeBase CE</a>
<br>TimeBase CE is a time-series database that aims to provide, as Open Source, an enterprise grade time-series data management and messaging capability which enables financial services firms to use with other open-source and commercial components to augment existing solutions and create new solutions. This project exists within the <a href="https://github.com/finos">FINOS</a> landscape; an organisation pushing forward the boundaries of Open Source engagment within Financial Services.
